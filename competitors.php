    <p>Typeform is another survey site but it's main focus is around minimalisam and drawing data out of users in a logical, mapped out fashion. This is achived by only having one question at a time displayed on screen, bold or italliciced individual words and the use of on-screen buttons and keyboard shortcuts that make navigating the site easy. To add to this, the icons and small views of the surveys you have already set up on your dashboard allow more insight and greater ease of use than a more text-based navigation environment. </p>

    <p>The idea of single questions per page and keyword highlighting is something that I would like to implement in to my project as I feel it dictates the flow through the website and alows a user to know what a question is asking at a glance. </p>

    <p>While creating a survey, Typeform try to suggest relevant templates that you can use but this isn’t too invasive and by no means do you have to pick a layout style you like before creating the content of the form. Also while creating a survey, you have the option to create logical pathways and narrate the flow of the questions, rather than it being a linear process. This is based off the answers to previous questions. You can also recall answers to previous questions to make the tone of your survey more personalised.  </p>

    <p>While typeform’s ease of use is much greater than that of survey monkey, it does have it's trade off’s. One of which being half of the question types are able to be trialed as part of thier ‘Pro’ platform. While this is good as it gives you access to view them and demo them, if you do use them within your form, it reders the form unshareable unless you upgrade to the ‘Pro tier platform’. </p>

    <p>Similar to Google Forms, typeform does support exporting responses to google sheets and other services suchas one drive aswell. These responses are shown to the creator of the survey in the form of bar charts with percentage annotations and collapsable lists to allow a breif look at most recent responses. </p>

    <p>Uniquely though, typeform offers other metrics aswell as just the responses from the questions. This includes things like time taken to complete the survey on anverage and how long aogo it was since the last response. This is useful data for quantifiying user experience of the form in a functional way. </p>
